# hello-world
This is a test repository created while completing the "Hello World" github tutorial. May use this repository for meeting recaps or ideas. Otherwise, might just delete.
As part of the tutorial, I am to write a bit about myself. I am a junior engineering student at Trinity University looking to get involved with aerospace/electrical engineering. Apart from academics, I am also an member of Trinity University's cross country and track and field teams. I live on the northeast side of San Antonio, in the same house as I have for the past 12 years. My car is a 1995 Geo Tracker.
